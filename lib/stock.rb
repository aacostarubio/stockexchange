# make a stock exchange
# third object that sits between stock and ticker
# takes stock prices and notifies of changes
# pairing
# test-drive code
# due Monday, January 28

# stock and ticker, ticker observes stock
# if we had 100 stocks, the ticker would be observing 100 stocks - problem
# adding stock exchange in between: ticker now observes 1 stock exchange, not 100 stocks
